https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2704/assignments/39998?module_item_id=765848


## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- GIVEN a functional Express.js API -->
<!-- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize -->
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
<!-- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database -->

## Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations
Fill out the unfinished routes in 
<!-- 1) product-routes.js,  -->
<!-- 2) tag-routes.js, and  -->
3) category-routes.js 

**Be sure to look at your module project's code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what req.body will be for POST and PUT routes!**

## Seed the Database
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

## Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start
Create the code needed in server.js to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
